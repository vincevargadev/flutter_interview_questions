# Flutter Interview Questions and Answers

## READ ME... pls

This document is a collection of questions that might come up during a Flutter interview. It should help both if you are an interviewee and an interviewer.

This document is not a guide on how to conduct interviews. That's a very difficult question that *you* should ask yourself, so I encourage you to talk to your team and discuss what's important for the role.

It's also not meant to tell you what you *absolutely* need to know before you can work as a Flutter developer. Most likely, you'll find some questions very easy, some questions will be in this weird category where you know you know the answer, but you might be in trouble formulating your answer in a clean, self-confident manner, and there might be a couple of questions that you couldn't answer yet.

Hopefully, most questions in this document will be pretty good question to ask a candidate, but without a doubt, you'll also find some questions that you think are silly. That's expected, and if you find questions that you think do not help you find the best person for the job, use your best judgment and skip the question.

There are plenty of things that software developers (including Flutter devs) should know that are not included in this document. Just think about object oriented programming, functional programming, design patterns, data structures and algorithms, clean code, test-driven development, a good intuition for app design, user interface design, and user experience, as well as how to communicate clearly and how to be a good addition to any team.

Flutter can target various platforms, and each of those platforms are their own fields, and they have their little quirks, rules, terminology, etc. Knowing these little things will make you a more efficient Flutter developer, but preparing for these questions are difficult, as each platform requires a different set of skills and knowledge. In this document, we will try to keep things high-level, and hope that you'll figure out the relevant bits of those fields yourself.

The answers are example answers. Sometimes, there is more than one correct answer. If you think you would answer the questions differently, that's probably fine for some questions. My answers were kept short and concise (around 1-2 minutes max per question).

These questions are great to filter out people who never actually used Flutter, and just try to wing the interview after reading a 5-paragraph medium article about Flutter.

### What happens when you execute the `flutter create` command?
